Notebooks
=========
In this directory you find a number of [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/)
which allow you to play with and visualize your data. When I'm working on
making nice plots for visualizing data I typically prototype them in Jupyter.

Included Notebooks:
* [Latency Heatmap](latency_heatmap/README.md)
